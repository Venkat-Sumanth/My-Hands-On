- OOPs stands for Object-Oriented Programming.
- Python supports different programming paradigms.
  
It supports:
1)Functional Programming:
  Functional programming is a programming paradigm in which we try to bind everything in a pure 
  mathematical functions style. 

2)Object Oriented Programming:
  It is a programming pattern that rounds around an object or entity is called object-oriented programming.

3)Procedure Oriented Programming:
  Procedure-oriented programming contains a group of instructions known as function. 
  There are multiple functions in the program.

-In the real world, everything is an object.
e.g., 
-to click the photo, the camera is an object.
-to work in a company, their employees are objects.

- Every object has two things:-
1. Attributes (An object knows something)
2. Behaviour (An object does something)

- An object can also have multiple properties as well as multiple behaviours.
- Variables are used to store data or attributes in an object.
- Methods are used to define the behaviour of an object.
- Methods in object-oriented programming are similar to functions.

-A class is a user-defined blueprint or prototype from which objects are created.
-In programming, a class is used to write the design of a program.
-Class is the design and an object is an instance.
