In programming, the number system is a way of representing numbers using different bases.
The most commonly used number systems in programming are the decimal (base 10), 
binary (base 2), octal (base 8), and hexadecimal (base 16) systems.

a)Decimal system: This is the number system we use in our everyday lives. It uses 10 digits (0-9) 
to represent numbers.

b)Binary system: This system uses only two digits (0 and 1) to represent numbers. It is commonly 
used in computer systems because digital devices work with binary signals.

c)Octal system: This system uses 8 digits (0-7) to represent numbers. It's often used in computer programming 
because it's a compact way to represent binary numbers.

d)Hexadecimal system: This system uses 16 digits (0-9 and A-F) to represent numbers. It's commonly used in 
 computer programming and web development to represent colors and memory addresses.
