- The language that the computer understands is Binary Code i.e, 0 and 1.
- We use a programming language to write code, which is neither a binary language nor English.
- Programming language has its own protocols and grammar which we use.
- We will write code in a programming language say Python and then it will convert into a binary format 
  that the computer will understand.
- We can perform several operations using Python language.

-As the interpreter wants to give you an exact answer for the division also, it will return it in float.
- If you want to get only the quotient part or the integer part of the answer and want to neglect the decimal 
  value, it can be done with the help of (//).
- // (double slash) is used for division when you want to return only an integer value in the answer.
- // is also called Integer Division or Floor Division.
-We need to follow the proper syntax for the programming language
- Double asterisks (**) is used to find the power of a number. 
  number ** power =  2**3 = 2*2*2
- To get the remainder, we use the modulus operator (%).
- Whenever we use strings, we need to use double quotes(" ") or single quotes(' ') with it in python

- Function is a set of tasks that can be done. We need to call functions. There are several functions 
  in Python like the print() function.
- Round brackets are used with a function to pass a parameter in it.
- We can define our own functions as well

- Concatenation is used to combine two things like we can convert two strings into one using concatenation.
- Concatenation is done using the (+) operator.
  e.g., 'navin' + 'navin'
  
- (\n) has a special meaning in Python. It is used to enter a new line.
- To print the original string or to neglect the meaning of \n, we have to use a Raw String.
- Raw string is a string that returns it as it is without making any changes to it.
