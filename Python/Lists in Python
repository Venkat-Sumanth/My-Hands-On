Lists are used to store multiple items in a single variable.
- We have to use a square bracket [], and in that square bracket, we can store multiple values.
- We can print the list through the variable name.
- Lists are Mutable which means values can be changed in the list.
- We can also get the single value from the list using the index value.
- The index value is 1 less than the size of a list as the index value starts from 0.
e.g., If the size of the list is 5, then its index value lies in the range of 0 to 4.
- We can fetch only those values from a list that are in the range of index values of it.
- We can also get a sub-list of a list by using the slicing in a list.
- We can also fetch the value from a list through negative numbers similar to strings.
- A list of strings can also be created.
- We can also create a list that can store values of different data types.
Like it can store integer value, float value, string value etc, in a single list.
- A list of lists can also be created which means a list can also store different lists in it as well.

- Several operations can also be performed using it and it has many in-built functions and methods to use.
- nums. shows all the functions that are available with the list.
- Ctrl + Space can also be used to show the methods.
- append method is used to add a new value to the end of a list.
- clear will clear the entire list.
- insert method can add a value in between the list at the specified index.
- A particular element can also be deleted through the remove method.
- pop method will also remove the element through the index value.
- If you don't specify the index value in the pop method, it will delete and return the last 
  element from the list.
- del is a command through which you can delete a sub-list or multiple values from a list.
  del list name[start:end]
- extend method is used to add multiple values or a sub-list in a list.
- sort method is used to get listed in the sorted order.
  nums.sort()
  
- min() function is used to get the minimum value present in a list.
- max() function is used to get the maximum value of a list.
- sum() function returns the sum of all of the values present inside the list.
